# Analysis of the Integrated Gradients Method by means of Adversarial Examples


In this work we give insight on some important techniques from the fields of explainable AI and adversarial examples. Those are the Integrated Gradients method for analysing what caused the prediction of a neural network and the fast gradient sign method for generating adversarial examples to attack a network as well as different defensive techniques against them. We will train our own networks on different datasets, attack them using FGSM and evaluate the robustness of our networks. Then we will use IG to analyse the attributions of these adversarials. Also, we will analyse attributions of images pertubated by random noise to see if adversarials have any special effect on IG. We come to the conclusion that this is not the case.
